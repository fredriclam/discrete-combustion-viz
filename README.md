OpenGL 3D Temperature Field Visualization

Based on Public License OpenGL tutorial at
http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/

Requires scientific temperature field data from discrete combustion heat diffusion model in a cylinder with heat loss boundary conditions.
Renders voxels with colour dependent on temperature according to a colour gradient.
Additive blending is used without the alpha channel.
